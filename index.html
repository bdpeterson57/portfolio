            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hello! I'm an Appian Consultant at Groundswell by day, where I've worked on various different client projects, and a video game enthusiast and general nerd by night. 
                I graduated from Virginia Tech with my B.S. in Computer Science in December 2022 and now live and work out of Northern VA. Outside of my day job, I've also created 
                a few different coding projects, including this website as well as some video games I've developed using LANGUAGE A and LANGUAGE B, all of which are available for 
                your viewing pleasure on my GitHub! Feel free to explore this little intro site as well as all my links!
            </p>
