README

----- PORTFOLIO WEBSITE -----

    Hello! This is my personal portfolio website. I created it as a way to showcase some of my software 
    development skills as well as personal achievements and experience. So feel free to take a look around!
    There's not much to it yet, so I'll be updating this readme as I build more of the website out.


----- HOME PAGE -----

    This is where I give a quick intro of myself and have all my links (LinkedIn, Instagram, GitHub), and 
    include some photos to give a better sense of who I am. On this page, as well as all the others, there is 
    also a navigation bar at the top to make your way between the different pages of my site.
